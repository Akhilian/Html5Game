Html5Game
=========

html5Game is a small 2D plateform game created using HTML5 and the new `<canvas>` marker.
This project has been developed using some full javascript code. The idea was to avoid to use a javascript game engine and create everything from scratch.

Tools
------
In order to improve some specific aspects of the project, i used:

* [Node.js] (http://nodejs.org/) to manage the multiplayer aspect.
* [RequireJS] (requirejs.org) to develop the project following the module pattern and to optimize the code (minification, obfuscation).
